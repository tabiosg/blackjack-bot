# Blackjack Bot

This Blackjack bot is a bot that will automatically play 
Blackjack for the user.

## This Project

When blackjack_bot.py is run, the game will automatically 
play for the player.
Currently, the bot has been adapted to work 
for Casino Stars Season 2 on Facebook.

## Instructions

On Casino Stars Season 2, the user must first navigate to a 
Blackjack lobby and sit in the middle seat. Then, the user must bet 
a certain amount. After this, the program will take over. It will 
make the most optimal decision when it is the player's turn (hit,
stand, fold, double, or split). The bot does not count cards.
The bot will automatically re-bet for the user. Press the escape
button on your keyboard to end the bot. The game must be fullscreen
for all of this to work.

## Work

Almost all of this project is my work. I based my calculator
